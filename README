CSE 132 Final Project: Automated Security Command Generation
Overview
This project builds an automated pipeline that generates offensive security commands aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. The goal is to understand adversarial techniques and explore AI-assisted security testing tools through a multi-agent system.
Project Goals

Develop a multi-agent pipeline for generating security commands
Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically produce commands for specific ATT&CK techniques
Validate command correctness and relevance to specified techniques
Generate a dataset of 500-700 diverse, syntactically correct security commands

Technical Approach
The pipeline follows a modular architecture with specialized stages:

Input Definition - Specify MITRE ATT&CK technique ID or description
Retrieval (RAG) - Extract relevant ATT&CK definitions and examples
Generation - Use LLM inference to create candidate commands
Structuring - Enforce predictable output schemas (JSON/Pydantic)
Validation - Verify syntactic validity and technique relevance
Output - Store results for analysis and benchmarking

Tech Stack

Infrastructure: Modal (cloud compute with GPU support)
Models: Open-source LLMs (Phi, Llama 3.1, 8B-70B parameters)
Tools: Outlines (structured output), RAG frameworks, HuggingFace
Dataset: Bash commands aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Deliverables

Public HuggingFace dataset (500-700 samples in Parquet format)
Comprehensive project report (4+ pages) covering methodology, challenges, and insights
Public Modal notebook with complete implementation
